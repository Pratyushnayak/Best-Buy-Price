              "\"Marvel's The Avengers (2012) is an awesome descent MCU superhero action flick that is spectacular and a real good one. The first time I watched it on my computer I loved it. I have seen this movie many times in the row I have this film on DVD and Blu-ray. The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. Joss Whedon did a fine job directing the film and I loved it is definitely in my top 10 favorite MCU superhero films. In the finale battle in New York the moment right there.. WILL NEVER... EVER.. BE AS COOL.. LIKE THIS WAS A COMIC MASTERPIECE.. I don't even read comics, but I did superheroes when I was younger.. I have a feeling justice league will never have this cohesion... this team work.. and will never be able to recreate this feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Downey Jr. does a good job as a Iron Man he has a lot of good moments when he talks with Loki. In the third act he has to fight Thor that was cool then in the third act he had to do a lot of stuff, did the final stuff to safe the world. He is very much star of the film, that is why he number 1 star of the film he was payed a lot of more money then the other actors did ,but he deserved it he did a good job. Chris Evans as Captain America was spectacular I love his character I love how he defended and safe those people in the restaurant against Loki's army I thought that was descent. He does kick some ass when Thor hits him he uses his shield when SHIELD's ship was attacked he and Iron Man were trying to fix the ship I loved that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMark Ruffalo was okay as The Hulk I thought he was better than Edward Norton's Hulk at least that is my opinion. Chris Hemsworth I liked him as Thor he was great. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was fantastic what does she do? She deals with the Hulk and Hawkeye the evil Hawkeye which I think is great. Jeremy Renner I like him a as an actor he is cool, he is mostly the bad guy in the film till the third act. In the third act he did a lot of cool stuff, he is cool with arrows. Loki he did fine the actor did fine as the villain I like him and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury did fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pacing to me I thought it was little boring and it was too long but the third act was really was fast paced and the movie interested how 6 superheroes become a team who turn in to Avengers I think there was a lot of action scenes in the film that were really well done. I like special effect, I had a lot of fun scenes Hulk punching Thor or punching Loki when he said is emperor. That was fun, the film it self had a lot of action it self's.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was entertaining, the CGI was really good, Robert Downey Jr. had a lot funny moments and hilarious dialogues. I have more enjoyed Captain America because he cared more about people and of course Iron Man he saved the world from Loki's invaders. I thought it was an alright and I love it. It is definitely my favorite MARVEL superhero movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmittedly the first half or so isn't nearly as epic as the final 30 minutes. And the plot isn't that original. But I got what I paid for with this flick, Awesome action with Earth's Mightiest Heroes kicking alien ass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Avengers in my honest opinion was better than Man of Steel because right next year DC superman movie come out that I have hated it and I wish I could have get the money back. I am going to try and sell the movie out.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarvel's The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have reviewed 2 years the second movie twice and as a MARVEL fan I can say I have enjoyed this movie much more than Avengers: Age of Ultron. I am waiting now on Avengers: Infinity War and of course Spider-Man: Homecoming which is a spin off Captain America: Civil War like I said I have enjoy all three Captain America Films and I enjoy both Avenger films and I love Iron Man and Iron Man Three I am one of the fans that I liked that films. The rating I give is 10/10\""

              "\"'Avengers Assemble' ('The Avengers') is a truly enjoyable superhero film that lives up to its hype and creates a story that allows for four of the greatest superheroes to connect in this mega-blockbuster extravaganza. Joss Whedon has created one of the most action-packed Marvel films to have graced the screen, full of humour, thrills and a great cast of characters, all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle. Whilst I had the great opportunity to watch this epic in the cinema in 3D, the film is equally as stunning on an average television set, with the final battle between the Avengers and Loki's army being one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie. An impressive and remarkable fantastical superhero flick from Whedon.\\r\\n72 out of 112 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.\\r\\nPermalink\""

              "'la review of \\'the avengers\\' (no spoilers)\\r\\n\\r\\ni was lucky enough to attend the marvel screening of \\'the avengers\\' on saturday morning in century city, ca. this was an unusual screening as movies of this caliber are not screened some three weeks before it\\'s release date. just minutes before the movie started, we were all surprised when writer/director joss whedon walked in with kevin feige to introduced their little \"justice league\" movie. not only did we all laugh, but some booed. lol. if that wasn\\'t enough of a surprise, the soft spoken whedon introduced on stage chris hemsworth (thor), tom hiddleston (loki), clark gregg (agent coulson) and cobie smulders (agent maria hill). wow is she stunning in person! the audience gave them all a standing ovation with deafening cheers! (this explained why the secret service like security were searching, wanding everyone. no cameras, cell phones, nothing was allowed in.) what a nice surprise for an early saturday morning screening.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'ve never read comic books. this is a comic book movie. it was made for hardcore fans of comics, and i appreciate the care joss whedon gives to this movie. it was very entertaining to see tony stark (iron man), thor, dr. bruce banner (hulk), steve rogers (captain america), natasha romanoff (black widow), clint barton (hawkeye), agent maria hill, agent phil coulson and director nick fury all interact with one another.\\r\\n\\r\\ncapt. steve rogers was fighting in wwii just yesterday. having been recently awoken from his frozen sleep, he struggles to fit in our modern world with all this technology around us. the god of thunder, thor, is not from this world (realm) and doesn\\'t understand modern technology on earth as well. dr. bruce banner has been on the run from the government, practicing medicine in third world countries. he hasn\\'t been the hulk in two years (what\\'s his secret? ;). tony stark is still the same, playing with this high tech toys and inventing new technology. so how do you get them all to interact and play well together? well, director joss whedon is the secret to making it all work.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe highlight of the film for me is how joss whedon has all these characters interact. deep character development was not needed for this film. (that is what the respective movies are for: thor, iron man, the incredible hulk, captain america: the first avenger) he does a great job of not forcing dialogue, and the interaction of the characters is much more organic than i would have ever anticipated. that is where whedon deserves the most credit. he took what appears to be a very silly premise, with silly looking characters and made it completely work. seeing as the avengers comics date back to the 1960s, you can tell he not only did his homework, but he really cares deeply for the material, and his passion definitely shows on- screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe movie is vastly entertaining. the action scenes are amazing and satisfying. nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences. i felt as if there was not a single bad performance. a couple of dialogue lines seemed off, but once you remember who the character is, and why they talk the way they do (think of where they come from), it all makes sense. each respective character is true and honest to itself. each of the characters brought their personality (from their respective movie) to the table. it is by far the best marvel movie to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nso who was my personal favorite character from the movie? dr. bruce banner (played by mark ruffalo) of course! he is by far the best bruce banner/hulk since bill bixby. his intelligence (genius) is unparalleled (greater than tony stark\\'s) and his compassion for human lives is what drives the good side of his character. as a kid growing up, he was my favorite marvel super hero. i enjoyed watching bill bixby play medical doctor/physicist dr. david banner on television. i\\'d watch, terrified with my hands up to my face, as he transformed into the raging green hulk. yet i was so fascinated with him being a scientist, helping those in need. when mark ruffalo was first announced to play bruce banner, i didn\\'t know what to think of it. i knew that he\\'s a good actor. all he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character out of him. i really hope they make an incredible hulk movie sequel starring mark ruffalo as dr. bruce banner. or at least, i vote for him to reprise his role in any sequel. he was a natural fit for this role.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, the best thing about these characters is that they are not silly twenty-something terrible actors who were chosen for on-screen eye candy. they all do a fine job of bringing these characters to life and their chemistry together works great. assembled, they are unstoppable. when i heard an avengers movie was rumored to be in the works, i was ecstatic. the day has finally come. go see it. thrice. 10/10 stars.'"
